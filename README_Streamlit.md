# 📋 Animal Farm App Analyzer & Testing Guide (Streamlit Edition)

Welcome to the **Animal Farm RAG Application Testing Suite**! This guide is designed for colleagues, presenters, and users new to George Orwell's *Animal Farm* to evaluate the performance, accuracy, and retrieval capabilities of our Streamlit application.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Document
